# Process

## Acquire and prepare the data

1. Open a Chrome tab to [my list of books at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/yourbooks)
2. Use the [Amazon/Kindle Book List Exporter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/amazonkindle-book-list-ex/cnmmnejiklbbkapmjegmldhaejjiejbo) extension to export my book list as a CSV.
3. Import the CSV into Excel, using Power Query to eliminate titles that were shared with me or that were just book samples. I want to analyze information *only* about books that I actually purchased or borred from the library.


## Analyze the data

Questions to ask:

1. How many distinct titles do I own? How many have I borrowed?
2. What format (ebook, paperback, hardcover, audio) is most common?
3. How many books have I purchased or borrowed in more than one format? When did I do that?
4. Which genre is most frequent?
5. Which author(s) are most common?
6. When do I most often acquire books? Are there quarterly/yearly patterns? Is there a time of day I'm more likely to buy or borrow?
